* Highlights
** Highlight one
:PROPERTIES:
:HIGHLIGHT: t
:END:

Led the migration of a monolithic payment processing service to a microservices
architecture, enabling independent deployments and reducing team release cycles
from two weeks to daily with no regression in stability.

** Highlight two
:PROPERTIES:
:HIGHLIGHT: t
:END:

Designed and built a real-time event ingestion pipeline capable of sustaining peak
traffic without data loss, replacing a fragile batch-based approach that had caused
repeated customer-facing outages.

** Highlight three
:PROPERTIES:
:HIGHLIGHT: t
:END:

Introduced structured observability practices — distributed tracing, standardised
logging, and service-level dashboards — across a platform team, significantly reducing
mean time to resolution during production incidents.

** Highlight four
:PROPERTIES:
:HIGHLIGHT: t
:END:

Drove the adoption of API contract testing and automated integration suites across
three teams, eliminating an entire class of production regressions caused by
undiscovered cross-service breaking changes.
